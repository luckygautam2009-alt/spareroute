/**
 * Decision Engine: Decides the resolution path based on verified evidence,

 *
 * Invariants:
 * 1. Claims vs Evidence: LLM output is claim; only dataStore is evidence.
 * 2. Customer Isolation: customerId is security boundary.
 * 3. Ownership check is deterministic and mandatory: If failed => HUMAN_ESCALATION, confidence 0.
 * 4. No Fabrication: Missing evidence => HUMAN_ESCALATION with clear statement.
 * 5. Security/Unauthorized Activity: NEVER AUTO_RESOLVE under any circumstance.
 * 6. High Confidence alone NEVER triggers AUTO_RESOLVE without satisfied evidence & policy.
